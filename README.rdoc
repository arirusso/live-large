Converts Ableton Live .als files to XML as their saved. The point of this is so that you can use git with your .als files.  Git is a lot more useful with line based text files then binary files.  Just gzip the .xml files and rename them to .als to have Ableton Live load them.

== Usage

  gem install guard
  gem install guard-live-set
  cd ~/Path/To/Root/Of/Ableton/LiveSets
  guard init live-set
  guard
